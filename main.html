<h1> Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the
        input. It measures the time taken to execute each statement of code in an algorithm. It is not going to examine
        the total execution time of an algorithm efficient. </p>
